# Inaugural project

The goal of this assignment is to analyze labor supply and the related factors from a consumer's perspective maximizing the agents' consumption. The optimal state for the consumer is when consumption is 1.24, labor is 0.40 and utility then 0.17. The development of the optimal consumption and labor, when the wage rate changes, is visualized in question two. With a population of 10,000 consumers and a uniform distributed wage rate, the tax revenue is 1627.39. When the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is reduced from 0.3 to 0.1, the tax revenue increases to 3206.92. In question 5, we examine the optimal level of standard and top bracket labor income tax, which maximizes tax revenue.
