# Data analysis project

Our data project is Analyzis of the Danish stock market which examines the OMXC 20 cap and the stock indexes concerning the financial, industrial and IT sectors. This clarifies the development of each sector, compared to the OMCX 20 and their volatility.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb). The data is downloaded from the API pydst.Dst, which accesses Statistic Denmark's data, and loads time series stock market data.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
