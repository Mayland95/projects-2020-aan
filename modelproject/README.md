# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Profit maximizing. The project concerns profit maximizing under normal circumstances and under covid19.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Model project.ipynb](Model project.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, you will need to install ipywidgets and possibly validate the extension to your jupyter notebook. This is done as below: 
pip install ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
