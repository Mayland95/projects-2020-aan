# Model analysis project

Our project is titled "The Solow-model for steady-state profit maximization". The project concerne the Solow-model where we begin by creating an analytical solution for the model, which in turn solves the steady state equation. The analytical solution is then turned in a python function, whereafter we derive a numerical solution using the bisection method. Lastly, we add a visualization through an interactive plot for the different levels of the capital function.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Model project.ipynb](Model project.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, you will need to install ipywidgets and possibly validate the extension to your jupyter notebook. This is done as below: 
pip install ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
